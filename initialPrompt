I want to create an example MCP (model context protocol) server example. It will be simple and actually expose simple CRUD API to add and remove items from a to do list. The list should be persisted. Please create a high level planning for this project. The planning should include at least: 1. Technology stack. E.g. NodeJS, express, jsonRPC, PG DB deployed via docker etc 2. project structure. 3. Maintain an up to date: readme file, tasks file and tests directory 4. approach is TDD so all new code must be covered in tests
